To implement your TCP chat application in Go following the specified requirements, you can break down the project into clear steps. Here’s a structured approach with suggested tools and practices for each step:

1. Set Up Your Go Environment
- Action: Ensure you have Go installed and set up a new project directory.
- Tools: Go modules (go mod init).
2. Define Your Project Structure
- Action: Create directories and files for your server, client, and any utility functions.
- Structure:
```bash
/TCPChat
    /cmd
        /server
            main.go
        /client
            main.go
    /pkg
        chat.go
        logger.go
```
3. Implement the TCP Server
- Action: Create a TCP server that listens for incoming connections.
- Tools: Use the net package.
- Steps:
    * Use net.Listen to create a listener on the specified port (default to 8989).
    * Accept connections with listener.Accept() in a loop.
4. Handle Client Connections
- Action: Use goroutines to handle multiple client connections concurrently.
- Tools: Goroutines, channels.
- Steps:
    * For each accepted connection, spawn a new goroutine to handle client interaction.
    * Maintain a slice or map to track connected clients.
5. Client Registration and Message Handling
- Action: Require clients to enter a name upon connection and handle incoming messages.
- Tools: Use buffered I/O (bufio) to read input.
- Steps:
    * Send the Linux logo and prompt for a name.
    * Store client names and ensure they are non-empty.
    * Implement message handling logic to send and receive messages from other clients.
6. Broadcasting Messages
- Action: Implement message broadcasting to all connected clients.
- Tools: Channels for message passing.
- Steps:
    * Create a message struct that includes timestamp, username, and message content.
    * Broadcast messages to all clients using a dedicated channel.
7. Manage Client Join/Leave Notifications
- Action: Notify all clients when a new client joins or leaves the chat.
- Steps:
    * On client join, broadcast a message to all existing clients.
    * On client disconnect, broadcast a leave message.
8. Sending Historical Messages to New Clients
- Action: Store messages in memory and send them to newly connected clients.
- Tools: Slice to store messages.
-Steps:
    * Maintain a slice of message structs.
    * When a new client connects, send them the stored messages.
9. Handle Disconnections Gracefully
- Action: Ensure that when a client disconnects, others remain connected.
- Steps:
    * Use a defer statement to clean up and remove the client from the list of connected clients upon disconnect.
10. Command-Line Argument Parsing
- Action: Allow users to specify a port or default to 8989.
- Tools: Use os.Args for command-line arguments.
- Steps:
    * Check for the correct number of arguments and parse the port number.
11. Implement Logging
- Action: Create a logger to log messages and events.
- Tools: Use the log package.
- Steps:
    * Write logs to a file for all messages and connection events.
12. Create the Client
- Action: Implement the client that connects to the server and sends messages.
- Tools: Similar to server; use net and bufio.
- Steps:
    * Connect to the server and prompt the user for their name.
    * Read user input and send it to the server.
    * Receive messages from the server and display them.
13. Testing
- Action: Write unit tests for both server and client components.
- Tools: Use Go’s testing framework.
- Steps:
    * Write tests for connection handling, message broadcasting, and client registration.
14. Bonus Features (Optional)
- Terminal UI: If desired, integrate a terminal UI using gocui.
- Group Chats: Implement logic to handle multiple chat groups by using maps or separate channels.
15. Error Handling
- Action: Ensure robust error handling throughout the application.
- Steps:
    * Check for errors on all network operations and handle them appropriately.
## Conclusion
Follow this structured approach, focusing on one step at a time, and utilize Go's concurrency features effectively. This will help you meet all the requirements while following good programming practices.
